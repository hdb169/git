I included scaler file in the data script too. 
still need to see carefully the current thresholdd of  5 uA (that is to analyse events with curr < 5 only) is applied well
why there is slight difference in current (>5uA) value is slightly different in the decimal place only than that in REPORT FILE
Included all the hms cuts for shms and vice versa, but in the numerator used only hms ntrack > 0 and hms delta  -100 to 100 and same for shms too.
MUst include the RAw Coin Time PEAK.
