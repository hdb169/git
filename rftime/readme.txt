1)pos_3p2_7767_marco and neg_3p2_7735_macro:

are two files, which calculats
the good count in two +/-3.2 GeV setting. Here I am using 5 different sets 
of cuts and calculate the ratio foe each cuts and compare these.

2)ratio_diff_3p2.C

reads the counts from these two files and calculates 
the counts/charge for each cuts and make the plot

3)........
